  <h2> About </h2>
  Hi! I am a fifth-year graduate student in astronomy at Seoul National University, working with prof. <a href="http://astro.snu.ac.kr/~wkim">Woong-Tae Kim</a>.
  I use controlled numerical simulations to get more physical insights about how interstellar medium in galaxy centers dynamically evolves, forms stars, launches galactic winds, and fuels nuclear activities.

  <h2> Research </h2>
  Observations and simulations demonstrate that gravitational torque from bars and spirals can transport gas to the central kiloparsec region of disk galaxies, enhancing the gas content and star formation activity there.
  Feedback from such localized star formation is thought to drive large-scale galactic winds, which is very important in regulating star formation in galaxies and enriching circumgalactic medium.
  Closer to the center, observations often find dusty nuclear spirals and/or circumnuclear disks that may fuel nuclear star formation or AGN activities.
  These phenomena of circumnuclear star formation, galactic winds, and nuclear activities are so intricately intertwined that it is difficult to study them in isolation.
  The overarching goal of my research is to study aforementioned astronomical processes and explore potential connections between them, using controlled numerical simulations of central kiloparsec of disk galaxies.

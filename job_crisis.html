  <h2>Below are interesting articles concerning the academia</h2>
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02223">Astronomy job crisis</a></br> : How the astronomy job market situation changed from past to present. </br>
<!--    <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0164784">The role of gender in the employment, career perception and research performance of recent PhD graduates from Dutch universities</a></br> -->
<!--    <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2016/05/employment-crisis-new-phds-illusion">'Employment crisis' for new PhDs is an illusion</a></br> -->
    <a href="https://theconversation.com/workaholism-isnt-a-valid-requirement-for-advancing-in-science-44555">Workaholism isn't a valid requirement for advancing in science</a></br> : An article written by astronomer Bryan Gaensler, about the work-life balance in academia, gender effect, and the role of senior scientist. </br>
    <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/349/6244/206">Getting noticed is half the battle</a></br> : A career advice published in Science magazine resulted <b>great controversy</b>. Here's that paragraph: </br>
<i>"I worked 16 to 17 hours a day, not just to make progress on the technology but also to publish our results in high-impact journals. How did I manage it? My wife—also a Ph.D. scientist—worked far less than I did; she took on the bulk of the domestic responsibilities. Our children spent many Saturdays and some Sundays playing in the company lobby. We made lunch in the break room microwave."</i> </br>
It is disappointing that academic society indeed published this kind of advise...
